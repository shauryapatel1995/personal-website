I am a fourth year doctoral candidate at University of British Columbia working with  [Dr. Alexandra Fedorova](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~sasha/) and [Dr. Margo Seltzer](https://seltzer.com/margo). I work on re-examining the data center memory management problem specifically the eviction and prefetching policies in the operating system.

I also work as a student researcher at Google as part of the Systems research group advised by [Dr. Kimberly Keeton](https://techsysinfra.google/research/srg-staff/kim-keeton/) and [Dr. Suli Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8jCusWsAAAAJ&hl=en). At google I work on understanding the problem of eviction without degrading application performance. 

I completed my Masters in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. During my time there I worked at PLASMA with Dr.Emery Berger and Dr. Hui Guan.

Prior to UMass I worked at Morgan Stanley on improving performance of distributed applications. I completed my undergraduate from Nirma University in Ahmedabad.
